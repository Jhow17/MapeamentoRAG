# Configure discovery scans in Alfresco

This section describes creating a discovery scan for Alfresco. See [Understanding discovery scans](/v1/docs/discovery-scans) for more information about Securiti discovery scans.

1. In Securiti, open **Sensitive Data Intelligence**, and choose **Discovery Scans > Scan Definitions**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> You can resize the width of columns appearing under the **Discovery Scans List** page. To do so, move the cursor to the edge of the column, then click and hold the left mouse button. Further, drag the cursor to the left or right to adjust the width of the column and release the mouse button.
2. On the **Create Discovery Scan** page **Scan Details** area, enter a convenient name and description for the scan job.
3. In the **Scope** section, apply the following settings:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Select Target | Choose **Alfresco**. |
| Select Data System(s) | Choose the specific data system instances to scan. |
4. Selecting the data system and its instance(es) enables the **Select Primary Scan** field. Specify any of your older scans as primary or the current one.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> When you select an unstructured data system, multiple scans might exist for that data system. You can mark the same scan that you are going to create as a primary or mark any of the older scans related to the same unstructured data system.

Click the **View Scans** link to view the specified scan on the Discovery Scans List page.
5. In the **Data System Scope**, select All or any specific repository from the **Specify Repository(s)** list you want to include or exclude from the scan. By default, the list has all repositories, user groups, and sites for those repositories.
6. In the **Scan Conditions**, select your desired file object category to include or exclude from the scan for your selected unstructured data system. This list of excluded file objects skips the processing of less important files and improves overall scan performance. You may add or remove additional exclusions based on your requirements.

![ds_scan_conditions.png](https://cdn.us.document360.io/37f15d15-eeac-4caf-9724-25918cca6992/Images/Documentation/uuid-04cd7e51-25ff-97e9-1277-642a8e6d6af7.png)

Securiti includes or excludes the files according to the following conditions:

If a file does not fall into the above 3 categories, it is downloaded and passed on for classification where it is again classified based on its content. Hence Some of the VOB files or .aax files were classified as they were below 10GB in size and not part of video file extensions as shown below:

![video_formats.png](https://cdn.us.document360.io/37f15d15-eeac-4caf-9724-25918cca6992/Images/Documentation/uuid-0306a29b-b6ad-80fd-eadb-6050d770881d(1).png)

You can include or exclude the File Owner field from the scan conditions to scan files for specific users only.
  - If the file size is 0 bytes, the file is not downloaded irrespective of extension but does show in the Dashboard as part of the skip policy.
  - If the file size is 10GB, the file is not downloaded irrespective of extension but does show in the Dashboard as part of the skip policy.
  - If the file extension is in common video formats(see image) then such files are not downloaded and are not shown as part of the dashboard.
7. In the **Advanced Settings** section, use the following settings for your unstructured data systems.
  1. Mark the checkbox for **Incremental Scan** to let Securiti scan only the new files and objects in the next scan and skip them in the subsequent scan.

In case of Alfresco, incremental scan includes only new or modified files in sites, user groups within repositories.
  2. Under the **Sampling** section, perform the following settings:

    1. Mark the checkbox for **Unstructured data** to select the sample of unstructured data using the percentage and size of the dataset.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> If you don’t mark the checkbox for Unstructured data, Securiti scans 100% of the files with a limit of 10 GB, which are part of this discovery scan scope. Marking the **Unstructured** **data** checkbox shows you the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Scan | Add the percentage of unstructured files that you want to include in the scan. Securiti uses probability approach to select files based on the specified percentage and scans only the selected files. > [!NOTE] > Note > > - Securiti evaluates each file independently and randomly determines whether to include it in the scan based on the configured sampling percentage. > - The actual number of scanned files can vary from the configured sampling percentage. For instance, if you configure a 20% sampling rate for 100 files, Securiti might scan 10, 17, or 25 files instead of exactly 20. |
| Scan up to | Add the size of each file that you want to include in the scan. For instance, if you set the unstructured sampling to 1MB, but a file is 3MB and contains personal or sensitive data, Securiti scans only 1MB of that file. |
    2. Mark the **Semi-structured** data checkbox and specify the percentage of files and the maximum number of records to include in this scan.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> If you don’t enable the **Semi-structured data** checkbox, Securiti scans 100% of these file types with no size or record limit. Marking the **Semi-structured** data checkbox shows you the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Scan | Add the percentage of semi-structured files that you want to include in the scan. These file types include: - AVRO - PARQUET - XLSX - CSV - TSV - ORC > [!NOTE] > Note > > - Securiti evaluates each file independently and randomly determines whether to include it in the scan based on the configured sampling percentage. > - The actual number of semi-structured scanned files can vary from the configured sampling percentage. For instance, if you configure a 20% sampling rate for 100 files, Securiti might scan 10, 17, or 25 files instead of exactly 20. |
| Scan upto | Specify the sample of records from semi-structured data that you want to include in the discovery scan. For example, if you specify a sample of 100 records in a discovery scan, Securiti shows 100 rows were detected for data elements under the discovery scan results. > [!NOTE] > **Note** > > There is a limit to scanning 100,000 records in the case of semi-structured data. |
  3. (Optional) If you have [private cloud storage configured](/v1/docs/system-settings-configuring-private-cloud-storage), mark the Collect Evidence checkbox. Enabling this option collects your scan results for each file in a separate evidence file, which can be viewed and downloaded from the Unstructured Data Discovery dashboard. For more information, see [viewing and downloading the classification evidence file](https://helpcenter.securiti.ai/docs/using-the-unstructured-data-discovery#viewing-and-downloading-the-classification-evidence-file)

Here, Securiti lets you configure additional options to define the volume of the evidence to be collected.

    - If no detections are found during a scan, individual evidence files are not generated; however, Securiti generates that scan’s evidence. When detections are present, Securiti creates unlimited merged evidence files until it reaches the limit of 4GB. If the evidence exceeds this threshold, evidence files are not generated further to maintain performance and system stability.
    - This customization is especially helpful for cost-conscious teams that want to manage storage usage by limiting the volume or scope of evidence collected.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence collected per Scan Job | - The default is set to unlimited per discovery scan job. - Securiti generates unlimited evidence files and merges them into a single merged evidence file until it reaches a cap of 4 GB. Alternatively, you can limit evidence collection to a specific number (e.g., up to 2.5 million) based on your storage capacity. |
| Evidence collected per Document | You can set this between 1 and 500,000 evidence per document detections. |
| Evidence collected per Data Element | You can set this between 1 and 100,000 evidence per data element detection. |
| Value | If you want to store the actual detections, mark the **Value** checkbox. |
| Metadata | If you want to see where this detection was found in the metadata, such as page number, sheet name, or column name. To use this option, mark the **Metadata** checkbox. |
| Context | Specify how many detections this scan must store after performing the discovery scan. You have the option to set the default limit and a higher context limit: |
| Default - 20 characters before and after value | Choose this option for the below detection outcomes as default: - Total detections per scan job (up to 2.5 million) - Total detections per document (up to 500,000) - Detections per data element type in each document (up to 100,000) |
| Higher - 150 characters before and after value | Choose this option for the below detection outcomes for a higher content collection around detections: - Total detections per scan job (up to 500,000) - Total detections per document (up to 100,000) - Detections per data element type in each document (up to 20,000) |

### Example use cases

    - To locate specific information with a limited number of data elements, configure the Evidence collected per Scan Job setting accordingly.
    - If you are looking for more information, for example, 100 detections per document and 10 data elements per document, Securiti generates ten evidence per document.
  4. Under the **Image Text Extraction** section, mark the **Extract text from images using** OCR checkbox to include images in OCR scanning.

Common image types include JPG, PNG, BMP, JPEG, and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> Text extraction from images using OCR is available only in environments where pods have been deployed. Securiti, then utilizes the extracted text for data classification.

Marking the **Extract text from images using OCR** checkbox shows you the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Min/Max megapixels | Set the minimum and maximum megapixels between 0.1 to 50, as Securiti skips images that exceed this limit, while the minimum default value is set to 0.01 and the maximum default value is set to 8. |
| Min / Max Aspect Ratio | Set the minimum and maximum aspect ratios between 0.2 (e.g., 1' × 5') and 10, as Securiti skips images that are too thin or shallow, making them unsuitable for scanning. The minimum default value is set to 0.2, and the maximum default value is set to 5. **Example** For an image with dimensions of 1000×748 (where 1000 is the width and 748 is the height, the aspect ratio is calculated by dividing the width by the height, which in this case becomes 1.33. We can adjust it according to the recommended setting to achieve the recommended aspect ratio between 0.2 to 5. > [!NOTE] > **Tip** > > For a better understanding of image dimensions and > > aspect ratios, visit the following: > > [Common aspect ratio for images and videos](https://marketing.istockphoto.com/blog/aspect-ratio/) > > [A guide to common aspect ratio, and image sizes](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/common-aspect-ratios-photo-image-sizes) To use OCR settings for efficient scanning > > performance, see [Use case examples of text extraction from images](/latest/docs/scan-conditions-to-use-ocr-settings). |
| Number of pdf pages | Set the number of PDF pages between 1 and 100 in the PDF document that should be scanned by our OCR engine. |
  5. Under the **File Text Extraction** section, mark the checkbox for **Extract text from compressed and archived files**. Enabling this option lets Securiti scan data from all the supported compressed file types.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> - Embedded file types include **PDF**, **Word** (doc, docx, docm, doct), **Excel** (xls, xlsx, xlsm), **PowerPoint** (ppt, pptx, pptm), and **Email** (EML) documents.
> - Archived and compressed files are scanned only when the **Archive** file type is included in the **Scan Conditions** and **Extract text from compressed and archived files** is enabled in the **Advanced Settings**. If the Archive file type is included in the conditions but extraction is disabled, the file is downloaded and sent to the content classifier, then skipped without being scanned. If the Archive file type is excluded from the Scan Conditions, the file is skipped by policy regardless of the extraction setting.
  6. Mark the checkbox for **Enable Similar Document Cluster Analysis** to let Securiti create clusters for similar documents that you can see on the **File Cluster Analysis** dashboard.

This option enables the identification of exactly similar or nearly similar documents in clusters. When you enable this option, Securiti takes up to 24 hours for cluster analysis to run automatically, or you can initiate it manually from [Configuring the file cluster analysis](/v1/docs/detecting-and-reducing-duplicate-and-near-duplicate-data#detect-duplicate-files). For more information, see [Using the cluster analysis dashboard](/v1/docs/detecting-and-reducing-duplicate-and-near-duplicate-data#detect-duplicate-files).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> The discovery scan job scans only the first 3000 characters in document clustering to detect duplicate documents.
  7. Mark the **Enable Data Subject Requests (DSR) Automation** on this datacheckbox to let Securiti index the scanned data elements for use when processing the DSR request. Securiti builds an index of all primary Data Element types, which includes:

Username

    - Email
    - Passport Number
    - Driver License Number
    - US SSN
    - TSA Precheck Number
    - US Tax Payer ID
    - US DoD ID Number
    - US VISA Number
    - US Alien Registration Number
    - IN Aadhaar Card Number
    - IN PAN Number
    - BR CPF
    - AU Medicare Number
    - AU Tax File Number
    - NZ NHI

A popup appears about the data elements that are automatically enabled for DSR processing.
  8. Mark the checkbox for the **Breach Impact Analysis** integrate it with the data breach module. This option shows only if an existing breach is detected for that connector. Enable this option to let Securiti analyze the breach impact.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> - This option is available for all unstructured data system connectors. If a connector does not support the discovery scan, then you can see this
> 
> **Breach Impact Analysis** toggle on the data system's **Permissions** tab.
> - To enable the **Enable Data Subject Requests (DSR) Automation on this Data** , you can configure another scan for the same data system instance and disable the Breach Impact Analysis from that scan.
8. In the **Sensitive Data**, choose the locality enabled for your tenant. Securiti shows the data element categories, content profiles, and exact data profiles available only for that locality for exact matching.
9. In the **Sensitive Data** area, choose the specific types of data to scan for. Click a category to open it and select specific elements or document types as shown below.

![sensitive_data_unstructured.png](https://cdn.us.document360.io/37f15d15-eeac-4caf-9724-25918cca6992/Images/Documentation/uuid-d4598628-9af1-a4d7-0b49-a7b2cbc2be4a.png)

![sensitive_data_unstructured2.png](https://cdn.us.document360.io/37f15d15-eeac-4caf-9724-25918cca6992/Images/Documentation/uuid-347926fd-5e5a-7344-7820-1b76e45e354e.png)

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> If you have enabled the data subject requests automation on the data, some of the data elements are disabled for customization. You can see the message ‘Personally Identifiable Data Element that helps with DSR automation’ when you hover over those data elements.
10. (Optional) In the **Responses**, choose what responses Securiti takes when the scan completes. You can specify one or more emails with a relevant email template.
11. (Optional) In the **Responses**, trigger a specified workflow. To do this, see [Discovery scan trigger node](/v1/docs/trigger-nodes-discovery-scan).
12. Near the top right side of the page, click **Finish and Activate**. To view discovery scan results, see [Viewing discovery scan results](/v1/docs/viewing-discovery-scan-results-en).
