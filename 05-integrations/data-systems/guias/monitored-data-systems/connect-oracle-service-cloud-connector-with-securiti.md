# Connect Oracle Service Cloud connector with Securiti

> [!NOTE]
> Note
> 
> Securiti stores sensitive connector credentials in an encrypted, base-64-encoded form. For self-hosted connectors, these credentials reside on your pod and are also stored in the Securiti cloud. A credential vault can also be used to store credentials for self-hosted connectors. If a vault is being used, credentials are retrieved securely from the vault at runtime on your pod and are not stored in the cloud.
> 
> 
> 
> For Securiti Cloud-hosted connectors, credentials are securely stored only in the Securiti cloud.

This topic covers setup of the Oracle Service Cloud (self-hosted) Connector.

| Region | Specify the GCP region where you want to host your Securiti instance. | `us-east-1` |
| Resource Name / Instance Id | In the **Resource Name / Instance Id**, enter the instance id for BigTable or Cloud SQL (MySQL, Postgres or SQLServer) instance, bucket name for cloud storage or dataset name for BigQuery. | `my-bigtable-instance` |
| Managed | Enable the **Managed** toggle to let Securiti differentiate between native and non-native assets (Dark assets). | - |

**IaaS-OCI**

| Parameter | Explanation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service Provider | Select your service provider as **OCI**. | OCI |
| Tenancy Id | To obtain the **Tenancy Id**, log in to your OCI Console, navigate to your tenancy details, and the Tenancy Id can be found in the tenancy information. | `ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaa` |
| Account Id | Similar to the Tenancy ID, the **Account ID** can be found in the tenancy information. | `ocid1.oc1..aaaaaaaa` |
| Region | Specify the OCI region where you want to host your Securiti instance. | `us-luke-1` |
| Managed | Enable the **Managed** toggle to let Securiti differentiate between native and non-native assets (Dark assets). | - |

**IaaS-Azure**

| Parameter | Explanation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service Provider | Select your Service provider as **Azure**. | Azure |
| Subscription ID | Enter the subscription id for your Azure resource. | - |
| Resource Group | Enter the resource group for your Azure resource. | - |
| Server / Storage Account Name | In the **Server / Storage Account Name**, enter the server name for SQL Server or Cosmos DB, or the storage account name for Blob Storage/File Share. | - |
| Region | Specify the AZURE region where you want to host your Securiti instance. | `us-luke-1` |
| Managed | Enable the **Managed** toggle to let Securiti differentiate between native and non-native assets (Dark assets). | - |

1. After configuring the hosting location and service provider information, continue by completing the following parameters:

| Parameter | Explanation | Example |

| Country | Select the country from the dropdown where the data source or resource is located. | America, Canada |
| (Optional) State | Select the state or region from the dropdown within the chosen country. | Alberta |
| (Optional) City | Enter the city where the data source or resource is located. | Calgary |
| Owners | Choose the primary owner for the Instance. By default, you are the primary owner. | John.doe@securiti.ai |
| (Optional) Additional owners can be added after creating an instance by enabling the **Add** **Co-owner** tab on the Basic Information page. From the dropdown, select users to add as additional owners. | Alex.doe@securiti.ai |
| (Optional) Enable the toggle for **Send Notification to all Owners** to notify owners. |  |
2. At the bottom of the page, click **Create and Continue**.
3. It redirects you to the **Authentication** page.

## Authenticating Oracle Service Cloud (Self-hosted) connector

After creating an Oracle Service Cloud connector instance, in the **Authentication** tab, authenticate your connector.

Apply the following settings using Credentials obtained in [Acquire authentication credentials in Oracle Service Cloud](/latest/docs/acquire-authentication-credentials-in-oracle-service-cloud).

1. Under the **Pod Configuration** section, from the **Select** **Pod** menu, choose the pod you configured earlier.
2. > [!WARNING]
> Important
> 
> - If this feature is not available in your tenant, contact your Customer Success Manager or Account Representative to confirm whether it is included in your plan and whether your tenant meets the eligibility requirements for its activation.

From the **PCS Destination** menu, select one of the configured PCS to store this data system connector's sensitive data, such as:

  - Table Training Sample files
  - Sensitive Data Intelligence protection evidence files
  - Scan Summary

> [!NOTE]
> Note
> 
> DSR Automation, Assessment Automation, and the transient metadata used during scanning continue to use the Default PCS configured for your tenant until those modules adopt multi-PCS support.

You can also migrate the data from one PCS to another while reconfiguring the connector. To migrate data from one PCS to another:

  1. On the activated data system instance, click on the **Reconfigure** link.
  2. From the **PCS Destination** menu, select the PCS where you want to migrate the data.
  3. Click **Reconfigure connector**.

Securiti shows you the migration progress bar to check the status of migration. Sensitive data is stored on the existing PCS bucket until the migration is complete.
3. In the **Credentials** section, configure the following settings:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Instance ID | Instance ID uses a string value. See example below: `example-Instance-id` |
| User Name | User Name uses a string value. See example below: `john.doe@example.com` |
| Password | Password uses a string value. See example below: `p@ssw0rd123` |
4. Click **Test** **Connection** at the bottom of the page.

### Monitoring the overview page and authentication statuses

After authenticating the connector, in the **Overview** section:

- Review connection test results.
- Verify the configured permissions.
- Verify the statuses for supported capabilities.

For more information, see [Using the connectors overview page](/latest/docs/new-ui-using-connectors-overview-page).

To monitor the authentication statuses, click **View Diagnostic Report** or the **Authentication** tab. For more information, see [Using data system connector authentication statuses](/latest/docs/using-data-system-connector-authentication-statuses).

## Configuring post-authentication scan settings

Proceed to the following topics to configure the post-authentication scan settings for the Oracle Service Cloud (Self-hosted):

- [Configure General scans settings for Oracle Service Cloud](/latest/docs/initiate-oracle-service-cloud-learning).

**Additional resources**

- [Fulfilling DSR requests for Oracle Service Cloud](/latest/docs/fulfilling-dsr-requests-for-oracle-service-cloud).
