2. At the bottom of the page, click **Create and Continue**.
3. It redirects you to the **Authentication** page.

## Authenticating the Alibaba Cloud OSS connector

After creating an Alibaba Cloud OSS connector instance, in the **Authentication** tab, authenticate your connector:

1. Under the **Pod Configuration** section, from the **Select** **Pod** menu, choose the pod you configured earlier.
2. > [!WARNING]
> Important
> 
> - If this feature is not available in your tenant, contact your Customer Success Manager or Account Representative to confirm whether it is included in your plan and whether your tenant meets the eligibility requirements for its activation.

From the **PCS Destination** menu, select one of the configured PCS to store this data system connector's sensitive data, such as:

  - Table Training Sample files
  - Sensitive Data Intelligence protection evidence files
  - Scan Summary

> [!NOTE]
> Note
> 
> DSR Automation, Assessment Automation, and the transient metadata used during scanning continue to use the Default PCS configured for your tenant until those modules adopt multi-PCS support.

You can also migrate the data from one PCS to another while reconfiguring the connector. To migrate data from one PCS to another:

  1. On the activated data system instance, click on the **Reconfigure** link.
  2. From the **PCS Destination** menu, select the PCS where you want to migrate the data.
  3. Click **Reconfigure connector**.

Securiti shows you the migration progress bar to check the status of migration. Sensitive data is stored on the existing PCS bucket until the migration is complete.
3. In the **Credentials** section, configure the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Region | Enter the OSS region for Alibaba OSS. See the example below. *oss-us-east-1* |
| (Read only) Bucket | This field displays your AliBaba OSS bucket name. See an example below. *alibaba-cloud-article* |
| Use Keyring | You can enable the Use Keyring toggle if you want to use a keyring to manage credentials for the instance as described in [Using keyrings](/v1/docs/using-keyrings). Then choose the keyring type, such as HashiCorp and keyring. |
| Token Id | Enter the AccessKey Token you recorded in step 4 of [Acquire authentication credentials in Alibaba OSS](/latest/docs/acquire-authentication-credentials-in-alibaba-cloud-oss). The Token Id uses string value. See an example below. *AkiAIoSfODnN7* |
| Token Secret | Enter the AccessKey Secret you recorded in step 4 of [Acquire authentication credentials in Alibaba OSS](/latest/docs/acquire-authentication-credentials-in-alibaba-cloud-oss). The Token Secret uses string value. See the example below. *XwWJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCY* |
| Evaluate data source size | Mark the checkbox to evaluate the data system size during authentication. The option computes the total size of all the files present under the given bucket name. Securiti calculates resource size on a weekly basis to keep the data size value up to date. > [!NOTE] > **Note** > > The evaluation of the data source size requires the **oss:GetBucketStat** permission. |
4. Click **Test** **Connection** at the bottom of the page

Securiti activates the connector.

### Monitoring the Overview page and authentication statuses

After authenticating the connector, in the **Overview** section:

- Review connection test results.
- Verify the configured permissions.
- Authenticate the statuses for supported capabilities.

For more information, see [Using the connectors overview page](/latest/docs/new-ui-using-connectors-overview-page).

To monitor the authentication statuses, click **View Diagnostic Report** or the **Authentication** tab. For more information, see [Using data system connector authentication statuses](/latest/docs/using-data-system-connector-authentication-statuses).

## Configuring post-authentication scans settings

Proceed to the following topics to configure the post-authentication scans settings for the Alibaba Cloud OSS:

- [Configure discovery scans in Alibaba Cloud OSS](/latest/docs/configure-discovery-scans-for-alibaba-cloud-oss).
- [Fulfilling DSR requests in Alibaba Cloud OSS](/latest/docs/fulfilling-dsr-requests-in-alibaba-oss).
