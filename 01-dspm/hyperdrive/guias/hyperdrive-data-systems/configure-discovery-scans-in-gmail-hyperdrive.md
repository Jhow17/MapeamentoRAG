# Configure discovery scans in Gmail (Google Workspace) (self-hosted) (Hyperdrive)

This section describes creating a Discovery scan for Gmail (Google Workspace) or Gmail Message Body (Legacy). See [Understanding discovery scans](/v1/docs/discovery-scans) for more information about Securiti discovery scans.

1. On the **Create Discovery scan** page under the **Scan Details** section, enter a convenient name and description for the scan job.
2. In the **Scope** section, apply the following settings:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Select Target | Choose Gmail (Google Workspace) |
| Select Data Systems | Choose the Data system instances to scan. |
3. In the **Data system Scope** section, select All or any specific container from the following:
  - For Gmail (Google Workspace), **Specify Domain(s)**, **Specify Groups**, and **Folders** list you want to include or exclude from the scan. By default, the list has all the Domains, Groups, and Folders marked as selected.
  - For Gmail Message Body (Legacy), **Specify Domain(s)** and **Specify Groups** list you want to include or exclude from the scan. By default, the list has all the Domains and Groups marked as selected.
4. In the **Scan Conditions** section, select your desired inclusion or exclusion attribute:

This inclusion or exclusion skips the processing of less important files and improves overall scan performance. You may add or remove additional exclusions based on your requirements.

Securiti includes or excludes the files according to the following conditions:
  - **File Name** (For Gmail Attachment Only)
  - **File Size**
  - **Created Date**
  - **Last Modified** (For Gmail Attachment Only)
  - If the file size is 0 bytes, the file is not downloaded, irrespective of extension, but does show in the Dashboard as part of the skip policy.
  - If the file size is 10GB, the file is not downloaded, irrespective of extension, but does show in the Dashboard as part of the skip policy.
  - If the file extension is in common video formats(see image), then such files are not downloaded and are not shown as part of the dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> If a file does not fall into the above 3 categories, it is downloaded and passed on for classification where it is again classified based on its content. Hence Some of the VOB files or .aax files were classified as they were below 10GB in size and not part of video file extensions as shown below:

5. In the **Advanced Settings** section, use the following settings for your Unstructured data systems.
  1. Mark the checkbox for **Incremental Scan** to let Securiti scan only the new files and objects in the next scan and skip them in the subsequent scan.

In the case of Gmail, an incremental scan includes only new or modified files, folders, groups, and domains.
  2. (Applies to G Suite Gmail only) Mark the **Scan Message Content for Mailboxes** checkbox to include the message body content for all folders in the scoped folders in the scoped Groups or Users.
    - Clear the **Scan Message Content for Mailboxes** if you only want to include mailboxes containing only attachments.

> [!NOTE]
> Note
> 
> - To use this feature, you must upgrade your pod version to release 1.142 or higher.
> - For older discovery scans, Securiti keeps the **Scan Message Content for Mailboxes** cleared by default to ensure backward compatibility.
  3. Under the **Sampling** section, perform the following settings:
    - Mark the checkbox for Unstructured data to select the sample of unstructured data using the percentage and size of the dataset.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> If you don’t mark the checkbox for Unstructured data, Securiti scans 100% of the files with a limit of 10 GB, which are part of this discovery scan scope. Marking the Unstructured data checkbox shows you the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Scan | Add the percentage of unstructured files that you want to include in the scan. Securiti uses probability approach to select files based on the specified percentage and scans only the selected files. > [!NOTE] > Note > > - Securiti evaluates each file independently and randomly determines whether to include it in the scan based on the configured sampling percentage. > - The actual number of scanned files can vary from the configured sampling percentage. For instance, if you configure a 20% sampling rate for 100 files, Securiti might scan 10, 17, or 25 files instead of exactly 20. |
| Scan up to | Add the size of each file that you want to include in the scan. For instance, if you set the unstructured sampling to 1MB, but a file is 3MB and contains personal or sensitive data, Securiti scans only 1MB of that file. |
  4. (Optional) If you have [private cloud storage configured](/v1/docs/system-settings-configuring-private-cloud-storage), mark the Collect Evidence checkbox. Enabling this option collects your scan results for each file in a separate evidence file, which can be viewed and downloaded from the Unstructured Data Discovery dashboard. For more information, see [viewing and downloading the classification evidence file](https://helpcenter.securiti.ai/docs/using-the-unstructured-data-discovery#viewing-and-downloading-the-classification-evidence-file)

Here, Securiti lets you configure additional options to define the volume of the evidence to be collected.

    - If no detections are found during a scan, individual evidence files are not generated; however, Securiti generates that scan’s evidence. When detections are present, Securiti creates unlimited merged evidence files until it reaches the limit of 4GB. If the evidence exceeds this threshold, evidence files are not generated further to maintain performance and system stability.
    - This customization is especially helpful for cost-conscious teams that want to manage storage usage by limiting the volume or scope of evidence collected.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence collected per Scan Job | - The default is set to unlimited per discovery scan job. - Securiti generates unlimited evidence files and merges them into a single merged evidence file until it reaches a cap of 4 GB. Alternatively, you can limit evidence collection to a specific number (e.g., up to 2.5 million) based on your storage capacity. |
| Evidence collected per Document | You can set this between 1 and 500,000 evidence per document detections. |
| Evidence collected per Data Element | You can set this between 1 and 100,000 evidence per data element detection. |
| Value | If you want to store the actual detections, mark the **Value** checkbox. |
| Metadata | If you want to see where this detection was found in the metadata, such as page number, sheet name, or column name. To use this option, mark the **Metadata** checkbox. |
| Context | Specify how many detections this scan must store after performing the discovery scan. You have the option to set the default limit and a higher context limit: |
| Default - 20 characters before and after value | Choose this option for the below detection outcomes as default: - Total detections per scan job (up to 2.5 million) - Total detections per document (up to 500,000) - Detections per data element type in each document (up to 100,000) |
| Higher - 150 characters before and after value | Choose this option for the below detection outcomes for a higher content collection around detections: - Total detections per scan job (up to 500,000) - Total detections per document (up to 100,000) - Detections per data element type in each document (up to 20,000) |

### Example use cases

    - To locate specific information with a limited number of data elements, configure the Evidence collected per Scan Job setting accordingly.
    - If you are looking for more information, for example, 100 detections per document and 10 data elements per document, Securiti generates ten evidence per document.
  5. Under the **Image Text Extraction** section, mark the **Extract text from images using** OCR checkbox to include images in OCR scanning.

Common image types include JPG, PNG, BMP, JPEG, and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> Text extraction from images using OCR is available only in environments where pods have been deployed. Securiti, then utilizes the extracted text for data classification.

Marking the **Extract text from images using OCR** checkbox shows you the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Min/Max megapixels | Set the minimum and maximum megapixels between 0.1 to 50, as Securiti skips images that exceed this limit, while the minimum default value is set to 0.01 and the maximum default value is set to 8. |
| Min / Max Aspect Ratio | Set the minimum and maximum aspect ratios between 0.2 (e.g., 1' × 5') and 10, as Securiti skips images that are too thin or shallow, making them unsuitable for scanning. The minimum default value is set to 0.2, and the maximum default value is set to 5. **Example** For an image with dimensions of 1000×748 (where 1000 is the width and 748 is the height, the aspect ratio is calculated by dividing the width by the height, which in this case becomes 1.33. We can adjust it according to the recommended setting to achieve the recommended aspect ratio between 0.2 to 5. > [!NOTE] > **Tip** > > For a better understanding of image dimensions and > > aspect ratios, visit the following: > > [Common aspect ratio for images and videos](https://marketing.istockphoto.com/blog/aspect-ratio/) > > [A guide to common aspect ratio, and image sizes](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/common-aspect-ratios-photo-image-sizes) To use OCR settings for efficient scanning > > performance, see [Use case examples of text extraction from images](/latest/docs/scan-conditions-to-use-ocr-settings). |
| Number of pdf pages | Set the number of PDF pages between 1 and 100 in the PDF document that should be scanned by our OCR engine. |
  6. Under the **File Text Extraction** section, mark the checkbox for **Extract text from compressed and archived files**. Enabling this option lets Securiti scan data from all the supported compressed file types.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**
> 
> - Embedded file types include **PDF**, **Word** (doc, docx, docm, doct), **Excel** (xls, xlsx, xlsm), **PowerPoint** (ppt, pptx, pptm), and **Email** (EML) documents.
> - Archived and compressed files are scanned only when the **Archive** file type is included in the **Scan Conditions** and **Extract text from compressed and archived files** is enabled in the **Advanced Settings**. If the Archive file type is included in the conditions but extraction is disabled, the file is downloaded and sent to the content classifier, then skipped without being scanned. If the Archive file type is excluded from the Scan Conditions, the file is skipped by policy regardless of the extraction setting.
6. In the **Sensitive data** section, apply the following settings:
  1. Choose the **Locality** enabled for your tenant. Securiti shows the Data element categories, content profiles, and exact data profiles available only for that locality for exact matching.
  2. In the **Sensitive data** section, choose the specific types of data to scan for. Click a category to open it and select specific elements or document types as shown below.

7. In the **Schedule** section, choose either **Run Manually** or **Run on periodic schedules**, as shown below:

![schedules_manually.png](https://cdn.us.document360.io/37f15d15-eeac-4caf-9724-25918cca6992/Images/Documentation/uuid-5c071aba-bf1e-b365-c856-0897717fad35(38).png)
  - **Running manual scans**

You can activate and deactivate the scans manually at any time and you can also start and cancel the scan any time you want.
  - **Running scans on a periodic basis**

The scheduled time starts and ends as per your local time or the time set in your device settings. Set the specific time for your scan, choose Daily, Weekly, or Monthly from the **Periodic Schedule Frequency**, and specify any time of the day, week, or month. You can also set the scan exclusion start and end time to pause your scan jobs for that particular interval only when you do not want to run it at specific intervals. The minimum pause interval that you can specify is one hour.

If a scan job runs for more than a day (e.g. for larger scans), and you set one hour as a pause interval, then the same pause interval of one hour will be followed every day.

![exclude_scan_time.png](https://cdn.us.document360.io/37f15d15-eeac-4caf-9724-25918cca6992/Images/Documentation/uuid-3fdb1871-3b9d-9ff4-b314-dd74eb8f8db9(34).png)
8. (Optional) In the **Responses** section, apply the following settings:
  1. Enable the **Send an email notification** toggle. choose what responses Securiti takes when the scan completes. You can specify one or more **Emails** with a relevant **Email notification template**.
  2. Enable the **Trigger Workflow** toggle to specify a specified Workflow. Then, click **Add Workflows**. To do this, configure a [Discovery scan trigger node](/v1/docs/trigger-nodes-discovery-scan).
9. Near the top right side of the page, click **Finish and Activate**.

A Discovery scan takes time to complete the process depending on the data available in the Data system Instance.
10. Refer to the matching procedure to view the Discovery scan results.

The live stats are refreshed and updated after periodic intervals until the scan is complete. To view Discovery scan results, see [Viewing discovery scan results](/v1/docs/viewing-discovery-scan-results-en).
  1. On the **Discovery Scans** page at the specific scan job Row, choose the More Actions (**three dots**) icon > **View Scan Scope**.
  2. On the Scan Scope Popup, click the scan job Row you want to view.

It expands the Scan Scope popup by showing the **Job Run Stats**.
